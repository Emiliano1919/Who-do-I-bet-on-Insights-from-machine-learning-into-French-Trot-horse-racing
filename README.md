# Who-do-I-bet-on-Insights-from-machine-learning-into-French-Trot-horse-racing
By Kevin Tawadros and Emiliano Jimenez Guadarrama, for the 2023 French Trot Horse Racing Competition of CANSSI Ontario.


We decided to approach the dataset given in this competition with a question in mind. If we had money to bet on a french trot race, who will we bet on?

Well the answer to this question is a horse that wins the race or at least wins enough money so that we dont lose ours. But this is not information we can obtain before the race so we will try to shed some light on this question with machine learning.

Probability in it's begining was used to shed some lights on the misteries of gambling we will return to this endeavor that sparked human inovation once agin, using maching learning.
